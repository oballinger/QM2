    "[Surveys](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2012/04/17/with-voters-focused-on-economy-obama-lead-narrows/) indicate that \"jobs\" are consistently one of the most important issues among voters in U.S. presidential elections, and that Republicans are [typically perceived](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3700047-republicans-hold-14-point-advantage-on-which-party-would-do-better-job-on-economy-poll/) as better in handling the economy than Democrats. An [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/where-did-trump-make-election-gains-unemployment-data-tells-surprising-n1247935) in NBC claims that \"analysis of unemployment and voting data found that the presidentâ€™s share of the vote held steady or increased in each of the 20 counties with the highest rise in unemployment from September 2019 to September 2020. And his vote share improved by 1 percentage point or more in 70 of the 100 hardest-hit counties.\" Let's look into this. \n",

    "There are only 50 states in the U.S. but there are over 3000 counties-- this allows us to increase our sample size and perform a more fine-grained analysis. This is particularly important if we're interested in investigating the relationship between unemployment and voting behaviour, because of the urban-rural divide. For example, with in the state of New York there are probably vast differences in social and economic factors relevant to voting behaviour between Manhattan and very rural areas; this variation is lost when we look at aggregate state-level resutls, but visible when we look at the county-level. As such, in addition to the datasets we've just imported, we're going to be downloading county-level unemployment data straight from the BLS using the loop below. "

Notice, the first two digits of the five-digit county FIPS code indicates the state. Boring, yes, but these codes are imperative in allowing us to join county- and state- level datasets from different sources quicky and easily.

Lets make a map to explore the spatial distribution of unemployment across time in the U.S. In order to do that, we're going to need a spatial file that tells us the shapes of the counties; I've imported it as a variable called `county_polygons`. We're then going to create an  map using the [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) library, which is great for making pretty, interactive maps and plots.

Of course, random assignment is usually not possible with most survey research. If we want to control for the effect of a variable, we must explicitly measure it. If we donâ€™t measure it, we canâ€™t control for it. In practice, there will almost certainly be some variables we have failed to measure (or have measured poorly), so our models will likely suffer from some degree of omitted variable bias. \n",
    ">When we have panel data (the same people/states/counties. etc. measured at two or more points in time) another alternative presents itself: we can use the subjects as their own controls. With panel data we can control for stable characteristics (i.e. characteristics that do not change across time) whether they are measured or not. These include such things as sex, race, and ethnicity for individuals, or urban/rural, topography, economic structure for geographic areas. The idea is that, whatever effect these variables have at one point in time, they will have the same effect at a different point in time because the values of such variables do not change. \n",

    "* $\\alpha_i$ and $\\epsilon_{it}$ are both error terms. $\\epsilon_{it}$ is different for each individual at each point in time. $\\alpha_i$ only varies across individuals but not across time. We can think of $\\alpha_i$ as representing the effects of all the time invariant/stable variables that have NOT been included in the model. So, given that we have 6 time periods for each county then the six records for county 1 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_1$, the six records for county 2 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_2$, etc. But, $\\epsilon_{it}$ is free to be different for every case at every time period.\n",

All that is left is the within-subject variability. So, with a fixed effects model, we are analyzing what causes individualâ€™s values to change across time. Variables whose values do not change (like race or gender) cannot cause changes across time (unless their effects change across time as well). However, whatever effect they have at one time is the same effect that they have at other times, so the effects of such stable characteristics are controlled. \n",

    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that we observe a signficant relationship between unemployment and voting behaviour in last week's workshop is that the Republican and Democratic parties have opposing views on what to do about unemployment. Democratic lawmakers have historically been in favour of increasing the minimum wage to benefit low-income workers, while Republicans have generally opposed this on the basis that it would hurt these very workers by increase unemployment. Indeed, classical economic theory holds that an increase in wages would lead to a reduction in employment; A business that makes $100k in revenue per year and spends all of it on employing 20 people can't suddenly start paying their workers double their salaries-- unless it fires half of its workers. This is obviously a simplified model though-- minimum wage laws typically don't double wages, and businesses don't operate at-cost, they turn a profit which they could use to pay their workers more. In the rest of this workshop, we're going to be investigating this question empirically: \n",

    "### Do minimum wage laws increase unemployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a *causal* question; i'm not asking if they're correlated-- i'm asking if one causes the other. The burden of proof here is much higher than observing correlations, and we have to think seriously about **endogeneity**. In partiuclar, we need to account for the influence of omitted variables (e.g. a recession, or the economic composition of a state), the potential for reverse causality (states implementing minimum wage laws in response to unemployment crises), and selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a lab, you can conduct causal inference by running an experiment. You can randomly select individuals, split them into a control group and a treatment group, measure their values in an outcome variable prior to a treatment, administer a treatment, and measure their respective values after the treatment. If you observe a change in the outcome variable in the treatment group after having administered the treatment, you can interpert that as the causal effect of treatment. This is because we're able to make a plausible argument that the **control group can act as a counterfactual (a stand-in) for the treatment group in the absence of treatment**. Both groups had the same values before the treatment, then the only thing that changed between them was the treatment, so if we observe a change in the outcome variable, it must be due to treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, we rarely get to run expermients of this kind. Instead, we have to hunt for **natural experiments**: situations in which there is a **treatment** which we're interested in measuring the effect of, and two groups that can plausibly act as a treatment and control group. \n",

DID is typically used to estimate the effect of a specific intervention or treatment (such as a passage of law, enactment of policy, or large-scale program implementation) by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a population that is enrolled in a program (the intervention group) and a population that is not (the control group).\n",

They ran a Difference-in-Differences model, and found that the coefficient $\\beta_3$ was positive but not statistically significant. In other words, the average total employees per restaurant *increased* after the minimum wage increased, but this could have been due to random chance. \n",

Let's see if we can replicate Card and Krueger's results with more recent data.

    "The plot above sort of looks like a set of descending staircases; this is for two reasons. The plateaus exist because each row in the dataframe `df_s` is the value of a state in a given *month*, but we only have minimum wage data for every *year*. So we get 12 consecutive values of minimum wage every year. The reason that the staircases are descending is because these minimum wages are adjusted for inflation. No matter where you're from, you've probably heard a grandparent say something along the lines of \"My parents would send me to the shops with 25 cents to buy groceries for the week\", but now it costs Â£9 for a bag of chips. That's inflation-- every year things tend to get slightly more expensive, so if the same *absolute* minimum wage actually diminishes in \"real\" terms, which is what the variable `minwage` measures. Incidentally, this is one of the main reasons University staff have been on [strike](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/11830/University-staff-pay-cut-by-20-new-figures-show). Anyway.

    "This plot shows that for the past fifty years, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have had largely similar minimum wage policies. There have been a couple moments of divergence, including in the 1990s when the Card and Krueger study was conducted. However, the biggest divergence actually started taking place in 2014 when New Jersey seems to have begun taking a wildly different approach. While Pennsylvania has had the same minimum wage since 2008 (and therefore seen a decline in inflation-adjusted wages), New Jersey has raised the minimum wage significantly twice. In 2020, New Jersey's minimum wage was around 50% higher than Pennsylvania's. We can exploit the fact that these two states have historically had similar minimum wage laws but have recently experienced a big divergence to see if that change in minimum wages has resulted in a change in employment levels. \n",
