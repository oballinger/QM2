# BASc0005 Notebooks - DAP (Data Analysis Project) Version

This folder contains modified versions of the QM2 workshop notebooks with new assessed questions and their complete solutions.

## Overview

Each notebook in this folder corresponds to a weekly workshop from the main course, but with **new assessed questions** designed to test students' understanding of the material covered in that week. Unlike the original notebooks which contain questions only, these notebooks include:

1. **New Assessed Questions**: Different from the original questions to provide fresh assessment material
2. **Complete Solutions**: Fully worked code solutions demonstrating best practices
3. **Detailed Explanations**: Comments and output that explain the analytical approach

## Purpose

These notebooks serve as:
- **Assessment Material**: Alternative questions for evaluating student learning
- **Learning Resources**: Worked examples students can study to understand proper analytical approaches
- **Teaching Aids**: Reference material for instructors to demonstrate solutions

## Usage Notes

- All solutions assume that the necessary datasets and setup code from earlier in each notebook have been executed
- Solutions include proper error handling and data validation where appropriate
- Code follows best practices for reproducibility and clarity
- Each solution includes interpretive output explaining the results

## Relationship to Original Notebooks

The original `notebooks` folder contains the course material with the original assessed questions. This `notebooks_master_2025_DAP` folder provides alternative assessment questions with solutions, allowing for:
- Test variation across years
- Practice material for students
- Reference solutions for teaching assistants
